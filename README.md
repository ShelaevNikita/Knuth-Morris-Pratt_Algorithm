# Knuth-Morris-Pratt-Algorithm
Algorithm for finding patterns in text using KMP function and parallelization of calculations

Parallelization of calculations is based on the number of lines in the source text
(the OpenMP library is used for this purpose)

For each number of threads (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16) the running time of the algorithm is measured 
and displayed on the screen, which You can see in the screenshots. 

Unfortunately, my laptop only has 4 cores :(

For information on how to use the app, see the screenshots

The end! :)
